# Data_Science
This repository serves to house all the Data Analytics Scripts that I have showcased in most of my YouTube Videos. This is a repository for various machine learning methods, theory, and models that I have done. 
- NOTE: There are a few repositorities I left by itself that are related to the Data Science knowledge: [**Ridge/Lasso/Elastic Net Material Github**](https://github.com/SpencerPao/Ridge-Lasso-ElasticNet)


## If you have any modeling requests, please write down an issue on this repository! :) 
- I'll consider doing a video on said topic.
