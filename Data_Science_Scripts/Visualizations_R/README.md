# Visualizations
This is a repository that includes many popular ways to create GREAT visualizations based on data. This currently only has R Scripts / Markdowns.

If you want to see the html document, you are going to have to knit the RMD file on your local machine. Unfortunately, the html file is too large on github.

Datasets in use:
- voting_data_1976_2020.csv: [**Link to Voting Data**](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/42MVDX)
- centroid_coordinates.csv: [**Link to Centroids Data**](https://developers.google.com/public-data/docs/canonical/states_csv) (I made a few edits from the raw source and have uploaded the dataset)
